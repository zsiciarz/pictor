What is Pictor?
===============

Pictor is an image processing library for PHP 5.3+. It will not work in older
PHP releases. Version 1.0 is still in development. So far the library is just
a crude OOP wrapper around PHP's GD extension, but hopefully a lot of features
will be added.


Features
========

 * Reading and writing PNG and JPG images
 * Drawing geometric primitives
 * Drawing text
 * Making selections and drawing only on some parts of the image
 * A basic plugin interface, making Pictor easy to extend
